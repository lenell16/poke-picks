# Poke Picks Vite React App

This README provides instructions on how to run the "Poke Picks" Vite-based React application on a new machine using `pnpm` as the package manager. Before you begin, ensure you have the necessary prerequisites installed on your new machine:

## Prerequisites

- pnpm: If you haven't installed `pnpm` globally on your new machine, you can install it using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install -g pnpm
   ```

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the "Poke Picks" Vite React app on your new machine using `pnpm`:

1. **Clone the Project Repository**: If you haven't already, clone the "Poke Picks" repository from your version control system (e.g., Git) or download the project source code from a source of your choice.

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:lenell16/poke-picks.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Open your terminal or command prompt and change the current directory to the root folder of the "Poke Picks" Vite React app.

   ```bash
   cd Poke-Picks
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Run the following command to install the project dependencies using `pnpm`:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

   This will download and install all the required packages.

4. **Start the Development Server**: Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running:

   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```

   This command will launch the development server, and you can access the "Poke Picks" app in your web browser at `http://localhost:517c`.
